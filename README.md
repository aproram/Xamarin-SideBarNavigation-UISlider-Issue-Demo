# UISlider Issue Demo on physical Device
This project to demo a problem I faced while trying to use UISlider with Sidebar Navigation component on Xamarin-iOS

to reproduce this problem you will need to apply the following:

1-UISlider inside UIScrollview inside UIViewController

2-Show that UIViewController as a content view of the SidebarController (Root view controller)

3-Run that on device (on simulator it works fine)

you will notice that the slider is not very smooth at sliding and you need to scroll it from the very center point..
